# Start the frontend app

Run `npm i` in the root folder  
Run `npm run start`

For testing with a mobile device you can download the Expo app.  
You will also need to be logged in to Expo on the development device (laptop/desktop that is running the code).  
To login type: `expo login` and fill out the parameters.

Contact Thomas to get added to the Expo organization so that you can log in with your own email and password.

For iOS, scan the QR code with your camera app, for Android you will need to scan the code from within the Expo app.

For Web, hit the w key to start up the website at `localhost:19000`

# Run Code Coverage and Jest E2E tests

To enable code coverage, toggle `collectCoverage` to `true` in `jest.config.ts` file. Coverage results are outputed to `jest-coverage` folder.

Run `npm run test:unit`
This will run all jest tests and output to the `junit.xml` file and to console.

# Run Code Coverage and Cypress E2E tests

Run `npm run web:dev`  
This starts the website in development mode, with access to the development plugins.  
Run `npm run open:cypress` or `npx cypress open` to open up the cypress testing interface.  
**Note: Running individual spec files will override the code coverage of the previous spec file**  
To generate a code-coverage report for all spec files, run the command `npx cypress run`. This will run all of the tests at the same time and output a combined code-coverage report at the end.  
To disable screenshots and video for cypress tests run `npm run test:cypress`  
After running tests, `.nyc_output` and `coverage` folders are generated. The coverage folder contains all of the code coverage results from the tests.  
More information can be found at [cypress docs](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage).  
The best way to view coverage results locally is to open the `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` file.
